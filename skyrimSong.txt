Alduin's wings, they did darken the sky
His roar fury's fire and his scales sharpened scythes
Men ran and they cowered and they fought and they died
They burned and they bled as they issued their cries
Dovahkiin Dovahkiin naal ok zin los vahriin
Wah dein vokul mahfaeraak ahst vaal
Ahrk fin norok paal graan fod nust hon zindro zaan
Dovahkiin fah hin kogaan mu draal
We need saviors to free us from Alduin's rage
Heroes on the field of this new war to wage
And if Alduin wins man is gone from this world
Lost in the shadow of the black wings unfurled
But then came the tongues on that terrible day
Steadfast as winter, they entered the fray
And all heard the music of Alduin's doom
The sweet song of Skyrim, sky-shattering Thu'um
And so the tongues freed us from Alduin's rage
Gave the gift of the voice, ushered in a new age
And if Alduin's eternal, then eternity's done
For his story is over and the dragons... Are gone
And so the tongues freed us from Alduin's rage
Gave the gift of the voice, ushered in a new age
And if Alduin's eternal, then eternity's done
For his story is over and the dragons... Are gone
